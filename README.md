# India-Climate-Analytics-Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard that visualises and analyses India's climate data based on certain factors.

### Introduction
With climate change being a pressing issue, this comprehensive climate analysis dashboard provides detailed insights into India's weather patterns, focusing on temperature, rainfall and other atmospheric conditions from 1960-2024. The visualisations help us analyse national trends, with a special focus on Kerala's climate patterns.

### Objectives
* To analyze temperature trends and variations across different regions of India.
* To track rainfall patterns and monsoon behavior, particularly in Kerala.
* To examine the relationship between various climate parameters (temperature, rainfall, humidity, and pressure).
* To provide future climate projections until 2040.

### National Temperature Trends

#### Key Insights
* The national average temperature shows a clear upward trend from 1960-2024, indicating significant warming across the country.
* The critical temperature threshold of 23°C has been breached multiple times after 2000, suggesting increased frequency of heat events.
* The highest recorded peak temperature reached an average of 23.11°C, creating a significant peak in the temperature trend graph.
* The geographic map shows how the temperature varies across the country with light blue in the northern regions showing low temperatures, variations of red showing high temperature and yellow along the coastal regions showing moderate temperature. (Kerala has a deep red color since there are more points in Kerala and we needed to do a detailed analysis of the state)
* Regional temperature comparison reveals distinctive patterns. Northern region consistently shows lowest temperatures throughout the year while the Eastern region maintains relatively lower temperatures due to year-round rainfall. Southern and Western regions demonstrate highest average temperatures consistently over the years
* Monthly temperature extremes analysis shows how the summer months( March-June) have the maximum temperature variations over the year. For the winter months, the temperatures can go very negative in the country leading to an increased gap between the maximum nd minimum values.
* The slicers in the dashboard help in more detailed data filtration based on the requirements.

### National Rainfall Trends

#### Key Insights
* Annual rainfall data indicates a significant overall declining trend since 1960.
* Recent years show increasingly unpredictable distribution of rainfall across seasons with the rainfall events occurring over shorter periods but with higher intensity.
* The stacked bar chart reveals distinct regional patterns. Eastern region dominates rainfall in pre-monsoon months and Southern region shows significant increase in post-monsoon months. The monsoon months see an even distribution of rainfall all throughout the nation.
* North-Eastern India receives highest rainfall across all seasons as per the geographic map(The bubble size is directly proportional to the amount of rainfall)
* Central India is experiencing a concerning decreasing trend in annual rainfall.
* Monthly rainfall patterns reveal that approximately 70% of the annual rainfall occurs during the monsoon months.
* Pre-monsoon rainfall shows a declining trend over recent decades while the post monsoon rainfall has become less predictable. There has been a clear shift in traditional seasonal rainfall patterns.

### Kerala Temperature Analysis

#### Key Insights
* The state of Kerala has experienced a marked increase in average temperature since 1990, showing a clear warming trend.
* Temperature trend analysis shows that the average baseline temperature is being exceeded more frequently in recent years.
* Temperature spikes have become more common after 2000, indicating increased heat stress.
* Winter cooling periods have reduced in duration and intensity.
* Monthly temperature chart shows that April and May consistently record the highest temperatures throughout the year. Summer-like conditions are extending beyond traditional summer months.
* Comparative analysis of recent years shows significant changes with the year 2019 recording the highest average temperatures in the studied period.
* The frequency of heat events have increased throughout the year.
* Monsoon months are showing reduced cooling effects compared to historical patterns.

### Kerala Rainfall Analysis

#### Key Insights
* Kerala's rainfall patterns show high variability compared to historical norms.
* Extreme rainfall events analysis reveals critical patterns with high intensity rainfall events occurring more frequently than in previous decades.The 2018 floods were characterized by unprecedented rainfall intensity.
* Dry spells between heavy rainfall periods have become more pronounced.
* Monthly rainfall distribution shows that peak rainfall periods are shifting from their traditional patterns.
* Rainfall is becoming more concentrated in fewer days throughout the year and monsoon rainfall variance has increased substantially in recent years.
* The flood analysis of Kerala reveals that strong correlations exist between atmospheric pressure patterns and extreme rainfall events.
* The changing rainfall distribution patterns impact flood frequency and intensity.
